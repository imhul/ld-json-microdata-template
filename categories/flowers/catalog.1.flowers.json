The original source of powerhouse strains like Sour Diesel and OG Kush, Chemdawg is known for its distinct, diesel-like aroma. Pungent and sharp, you’ll be able to smell this hybrid from a mile away. Cannabis newbies be warned: Chemdawg tends to be very potent. Depending on grow conditions, this strain tends to have extremely high THC levels. Consumers can expect to have a very cerebral experience, coupled with a strong heavy-bodied feeling.",

A sight too behold, excellent evening time strain, such a lovely terpene content and trichrome development is quite lovely perfect for some dry soft! Such lovely purple, red and orange hairs such beautiful buds",

            "description": "A cross between 2 of the most popular sativas, Snowcap and Lemon skunk. Clean, focus high, strong body stoned and also a relaxed tingly body stoned. The high isn’t too strong and focuses on being a heady high with the sativa effects of a spirit lift, mood boost, and energized focus. One of the better sativa’s out there. This is a great socializing strain. First of all, the smell is phenomenal. The lemon and citrus profiles really stand out and give off a delicious scent! The nugs are bright green with bright orange hairs all over. This is a great mood pick me up because it will make you forget what you were mad about in the first place. Wonderful for sativa lovers!",

It definitely, as I don’t have the bud in front of me I’m going off of memories , has orange smells, but once smoked was when the citrus really came out! I personally found Mimosa, the pheno that Silverstem carries to be a rid bit racy for me, but then again I LOVE MY Indicas!!!!! So if you are a lover of anything citrus this will definitely be a good medicinal strain for you! If I go for citrus I typically go for that Lemon Funk, only ongange strains I really truly love are orange Herijuana, Orange Kush and Colorado Clementine, so this is a bit to much on the Sativa side, I can only take a few hits at most, the flavor is sublime, it’s very heady high, definitely not a stone. So if you suffer from extreme anxiety, well I’ve seen it go both ways, as it helps my fiancé, but not so much for me, it’s worth picking up a gram and trying, as there are definitely medicinal values to be had, unfortunately for me this was not the one, I tend to go towards Silverstems True OG, OG Kush, Deep Chunk, purple erkle, as they’ve knocked it out of the park everytime I had one of those strains, they’re the ones that keep me going back, so if citrus and oranges is your thing, try it out, may become a new favorite!!!!",

Such lovely aroma and the flavour is there, Silverstem has the dankest dank in Colorado hands down for dispensary grown this is as good as it gets, no overstressed plants here; growing done right, and organically, #dontpanicitsorganic If OG Kush is your thang, you like overly kushy flavour with a heavy body stone but the mind high isn’t missing either, love this strain and love their cut it shines when it’s fresh the flavour is so rich, trichrome development is impressive and with a slight cure will lead to so much frost it’ll cover your kief collector, if you can keep it that long! I’m not sure if they’ve got is maybe a ghost cut or who knows but it’s dank , this cut is definitely indica dominate, similar to their True OG, not as heavy of an og or indica as the True OG mind you, it’s more for the daytime for me the True OG for night, a bit more Sativa end for this og Kush, absolutely delicious, pine, Earth, hash, and Kush love it so much!",

This is what Purp Erkle should taste like, the terpenes are spot on, lovely berries with hints of pine, and you grind the buds you see the dark hues of the buds greens, reds, purples and blacks! This is my girlfriend/fiancés number one go to strain, as the ceiling isn’t there, tolerance seems to not be built up easily on this strain, pain relief and insomnia relief are excellent this is your typical Afghani squat, greasy, berries and pine such a classic staple and it’s clear why! Silverstem delivers clean meds, that you can taste the terps, they really do this strain justice, they care and it shows!!!!",

So you’re left with the love child of the two, bud is a gorgeous purple, red, and orange hairs, the smoke is most definitely pleasant, kind of hard to place the flavor but where the snowcap would give me anxiety and paranoia after even a bowl, smoked two bowls, and I’m feeling GREAT!!! I’m a daily dabber so I’ve got an abnormally high tolerance so please be ware if you’re a newer smoker, it might crush at a whopping 26.5% THC-A cbd-a .53%. So if you’re new too smoking please keep that in mind, I medicate for pain, anxiety, ptsd, and it super effective and efficient for me for all of these issues. I had a headache before smoking and I can say I feel no pain at the moment. Oh and did I describe how the bud was literally covered in trichromes and just gorgeous buds!!!!!! In the flavor I get a light lemon haze with an earthy aftertaste, although I have a feeling if it was vaporized a whole plethora of flavors would/will abound, this is the next method I’ll try will be vaporization! I’ve found a new favorite strain at Silverstem, one other than their KILLER OG cuts, like their true and OG kush, this is a nice hybrid, with both the positives of both parents and seeming to me at this moment having none of the negatives like paranoia and anxiety I usually would get from their Snowcap, which is what gives this hybrid it’s locely flavor from, and the P Urkle obviously contributed the bud color, and some jars and their massive trichrome production known from their purple urkle...",
