            "description": "A cross between 2 of the most popular sativas, Snowcap and Lemon skunk. Clean, focus high, strong body stoned and also a relaxed tingly body stoned. The high isn’t too strong and focuses on being a heady high with the sativa effects of a spirit lift, mood boost, and energized focus. One of the better sativa’s out there. This is a great socializing strain. First of all, the smell is phenomenal. The lemon and citrus profiles really stand out and give off a delicious scent! The nugs are bright green with bright orange hairs all over. This is a great mood pick me up because it will make you forget what you were mad about in the first place. Wonderful for sativa lovers!",

It definitely, as I don’t have the bud in front of me I’m going off of memories , has orange smells, but once smoked was when the citrus really came out! I personally found Mimosa, the pheno that Silverstem carries to be a rid bit racy for me, but then again I LOVE MY Indicas!!!!! So if you are a lover of anything citrus this will definitely be a good medicinal strain for you! If I go for citrus I typically go for that Lemon Funk, only ongange strains I really truly love are orange Herijuana, Orange Kush and Colorado Clementine, so this is a bit to much on the Sativa side, I can only take a few hits at most, the flavor is sublime, it’s very heady high, definitely not a stone. So if you suffer from extreme anxiety, well I’ve seen it go both ways, as it helps my fiancé, but not so much for me, it’s worth picking up a gram and trying, as there are definitely medicinal values to be had, unfortunately for me this was not the one, I tend to go towards Silverstems True OG, OG Kush, Deep Chunk, purple erkle, as they’ve knocked it out of the park everytime I had one of those strains, they’re the ones that keep me going back, so if citrus and oranges is your thing, try it out, may become a new favorite!!!!",
