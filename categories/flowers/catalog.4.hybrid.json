Such lovely aroma and the flavour is there, Silverstem has the dankest dank in Colorado hands down for dispensary grown this is as good as it gets, no overstressed plants here; growing done right, and organically, #dontpanicitsorganic If OG Kush is your thang, you like overly kushy flavour with a heavy body stone but the mind high isn’t missing either, love this strain and love their cut it shines when it’s fresh the flavour is so rich, trichrome development is impressive and with a slight cure will lead to so much frost it’ll cover your kief collector, if you can keep it that long! I’m not sure if they’ve got is maybe a ghost cut or who knows but it’s dank , this cut is definitely indica dominate, similar to their True OG, not as heavy of an og or indica as the True OG mind you, it’s more for the daytime for me the True OG for night, a bit more Sativa end for this og Kush, absolutely delicious, pine, Earth, hash, and Kush love it so much!",

So you’re left with the love child of the two, bud is a gorgeous purple, red, and orange hairs, the smoke is most definitely pleasant, kind of hard to place the flavor but where the snowcap would give me anxiety and paranoia after even a bowl, smoked two bowls, and I’m feeling GREAT!!! I’m a daily dabber so I’ve got an abnormally high tolerance so please be ware if you’re a newer smoker, it might crush at a whopping 26.5% THC-A cbd-a .53%. So if you’re new too smoking please keep that in mind, I medicate for pain, anxiety, ptsd, and it super effective and efficient for me for all of these issues. I had a headache before smoking and I can say I feel no pain at the moment. Oh and did I describe how the bud was literally covered in trichromes and just gorgeous buds!!!!!! In the flavor I get a light lemon haze with an earthy aftertaste, although I have a feeling if it was vaporized a whole plethora of flavors would/will abound, this is the next method I’ll try will be vaporization! I’ve found a new favorite strain at Silverstem, one other than their KILLER OG cuts, like their true and OG kush, this is a nice hybrid, with both the positives of both parents and seeming to me at this moment having none of the negatives like paranoia and anxiety I usually would get from their Snowcap, which is what gives this hybrid it’s locely flavor from, and the P Urkle obviously contributed the bud color, and some jars and their massive trichrome production known from their purple urkle...",
