                    "description": "Silverstem’s Purple Erkle, some of the Prettiest buds I’ve seen in the Denver area, so frosty and just beautiful, the taste is your typical purple erkle, nothing new but man they do it right!!! This is what Purp Erkle should taste like, the terpenes are spot on, lovely berries with hints of pine, and you grind the buds you see the dark hues of the buds greens, reds, purples and blacks! This is my girlfriend/fiancés number one go to strain, as the ceiling isn’t there, tolerance seems to not be built up easily on this strain, pain relief and insomnia relief are excellent this is your typical Afghani squat, greasy, berries and pine such a classic staple and it’s clear why! Silverstem delivers clean meds, that you can taste the terps, they really do this strain justice, they care and it shows!!!!",

Lovely trichome development, I wish I had a clone of this as this is one of my top 5 all time favorite strains, and they knock it out of the park every grow!!!! On this strain I’ve yet to see any seeds, out of the Purp Erkle out of the multiple ounces my girlfriend and I get we’ve found 2-3 seeds, same for the OG Kush, none yet for this strain, guess I’ll keep buying till I get one of them keeper tokens, lol this is the best bud in Denver!!!!!!",
